Description of the challenge taken from competetion page : When selling used goods online, a combination of little things can make a large difference.

And, even with an optimized product listing, demand for a product may simply not exist–frustrating sellers who may have over-invested in marketing. Avito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good description was underpriced).

Avito is one of the biggest classified advertisment website. In this project we are trying to predict the deal_probability using machine learning model before which we perform some operations related to data cleaning, visualization etc to understand the data. So that we can determine which are the essential factors for successfull deal_probability.
